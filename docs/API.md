# API Reference

Current surface: Logic Pro MCP exposes 10 tools, 18 static resources, and 12 resource templates. What each release changed, including every breaking response shape, is in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md); this page describes the surface, not its history.

Use tools for actions. Use resources for state. Treat every mutating result as one of:

- State A: confirmed success. The server wrote to Logic and independently read the result back.
- State B: uncertain success. The server attempted the action but could not verify the result.
- State C: hard failure. The action did not land and is safe to retry only when `retry_safe` says so.

## MCP Capabilities

`initialize` advertises `resources.subscribe: true`, `resources.listChanged: false`, `prompts.listChanged: false`, and `tools.listChanged: false`.

Resource subscriptions are session-scoped. `resources/subscribe` and `resources/unsubscribe` accept any listed resource URI or concrete resource-template URI. When a subscribed state resource changes, the server sends `notifications/resources/updated` with the changed `uri`. Change detection hashes the stable `data` payload of cache-envelope resources, or the whole payload for non-envelope resources, after recursively excluding volatile keys: `generated_at`, `fetched_at`, `cache_age_sec`, and `mcu_last_feedback_age_ms`.

`prompts/list` and `prompts/get` expose the workflow skill catalog as prompt templates. Prompt definitions are derived from `WorkflowSkillCatalog`, the same source used by `logic://workflow-skills`.

Every tool in `tools/list` advertises an `outputSchema`. Mixed command tools advertise the Honest Contract envelope for mutating commands: mutating commands return the Honest Contract envelope (`success`/`verified`/`state`, additional operation-specific keys); read-only commands return command-specific JSON objects. Honest Contract properties are non-required so read-only responses validate against the mixed-tool schema. Read-only/read-ish tools advertise a generic JSON object. For `tools/call`, when the text response is already a JSON object, the same object is also attached as `structuredContent`; the text payload is unchanged for backward compatibility.

## Resource Templates

`logic://system/operations` (exact read-only catalog URI), `logic://tracks/{index}`, `logic://tracks/{index}/regions`, `logic://mixer/{strip}`,
`logic://stock-plugins/{id}`, `logic://stock-plugins/search?query={query}`,
`logic://stock-instruments/{id}`, `logic://stock-instruments/search?query={query}`,
`logic://session-players/{id}`, `logic://workflow-plans/session?prompt={prompt}`,
`logic://workflow-skills/{id}`, `logic://workflow-skills/search?query={query}`.

Registered operations reject unknown command-parameter keys at the runtime boundary by default, before cache access, mutation gates, or dispatcher invocation. The State C `invalid_params` response includes sorted `unknown_params` and `allowed_params`. Selector keys are operation-scoped: `target_ref` is recognized only when the operation's target policy is `accepts_stable_target`, while `index` and `track` appear only on operations whose dispatcher consumes those aliases. `expected_name` is recognized only on the `corroborated` index-binding tier (see [Index binding](#index-binding)). The exact per-operation set is published by `logic://system/operations`; `record_sequence` also preserves its ignored `instrument` / `instrument_path` inputs. Set `LOGIC_MCP_ADR003_STRICT_PARAMS=0` only as a temporary compatibility escape hatch for registered-command parameter pass-through; it does not expose unregistered commands or dispatcher-only aliases.

### Index binding

A track index is an **ordinal, not an identity**. Between the moment you read `logic://tracks` and the moment your write lands, a drag, a track creation, or a folder collapse can shift every row — and an index-keyed write then lands on a track you never named. `target_ref` (ADR-002) solves this by binding to a session-stable identity. It is accepted **by default** — set `LOGIC_MCP_ADR002_TARGET_REF=0` to disable the machinery, after which any supplied `target_ref` fails closed with `target_ref_unavailable`. But the server being willing to accept a `target_ref` does not make callers send one: the bare-index path stays open, so the registry declares what each operation demands of a **bare index** on a second, orthogonal axis: `index_binding`, published per-operation by `logic://system/operations`.

The field is present only on operations that are both target-bearing (`target` = `accepts_stable_target`) and mutating — the only ones with an index path that can hit a wrong target. Read-only and non-target operations omit it entirely rather than publishing a null.

| Tier | Meaning | Today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ref_required` | A bare index is refused; only `target_ref` binds. | **No operations.** Implemented and tested; the first promotion is a registry row flip and will appear as a catalog diff. |
| `corroborated` | A bare index must be corroborated by `expected_name`. | `tracks.delete`, `tracks.duplicate`, `tracks.set_instrument`, `plugins.insert_verified` |
| `legacy_index_allowed` | The historical unguarded index path. | **Deprecated** — see below. |

#### The corroboration contract

For a `corroborated` operation called **without** `target_ref`, supply `expected_name`: the track name you believe sits at the index. (It is not spelled `name` because several of these operations already spend `name` on an operand — `tracks.rename`'s new name, `tracks.select`'s by-name selector.) The server then reads the **live** track header before writing — never the state cache, which lags an out-of-band reorder by the poll interval and would therefore agree with exactly the stale view being defended against.

Every failure below is fail-closed and **pre-write**: `write_attempted: false` is a fact, not a claim — the operation returns before anything is routed.

| Condition | State C error | `safe_to_retry` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No `expected_name` and no `target_ref` | `index_binding_corroboration_required` | `true` — supply either binding |
| Live name at the index ≠ `expected_name` | `target_identity_mismatch` (`reason: name_mismatch`) | `false` — re-read `logic://tracks` first |
| Live header unreadable | `target_identity_mismatch` (`reason: header_unreadable`) | `false` — an unreadable surface is never read as agreement |
| `expected_name` matches but names >1 live track | `ambiguous_target_name` (`ambiguous_track_indices` lists all colliding indices) | `false` — use `target_ref` |
| `expected_name` **and** `target_ref` both supplied | `invalid_params` | `true` — send exactly one binding |

Uniqueness is not a nicety. Two tracks sharing a name can swap positions and leave `(index, name)` self-consistent at **both** ordinals, so a match would prove nothing; `target_ref` is the only binding a swap cannot fool. Supplying `target_ref` bypasses this path entirely — the reference machinery carries its own live-identity and ambiguity checks, and the two are never stacked.

**Corroboration is a pre-write proof, not atomic with the write.** It reads the live header, then writes; a reorder that lands in that narrow guard-to-write interval can still put the write on the wrong track. Corroboration *narrows* the wrong-target window (from "any time since your last read" down to "the guard-to-write interval"); it does not eliminate it. Only `target_ref` — and the future `ref_required` tier — bind an identity that holds across the write and close the window entirely. Prefer `target_ref` when wrong-target cost is high.

`expected_name` is a binding proof, not a write parameter: it is never forwarded to the channel, and a matching, unique corroboration leaves the existing index write path completely unchanged.

#### Deprecation: `legacy_index_allowed`

This tier is the pre-ratchet behaviour and is **deprecated**. Its members still write to a bare, unproven ordinal; each remains only because a wrong-target write there is *recoverable* (`mixer.set_volume`, `mixer.set_pan`, `plugins.set_param_verified`, `tracks.select`, `tracks.rename`, `tracks.mute`, `tracks.solo`, `tracks.arm`, `tracks.arm_only`, `tracks.set_automation`). The set is pinned by census and may only shrink. Prefer `target_ref` on these operations today; do not build on the assumption that a bare index will keep being accepted.

A gap is tracked rather than papered over: two mutating operations key on a track strip yet carry target policy `none` — **`mixer.insert_plugin`** (irreversible insert) and **`mixer.set_plugin_param`** (reversible param write). Because they accept no `target_ref`, the corroboration refusal could not honestly offer one as an alternative, so neither carries a tier. Ratcheting either requires first making it target-bearing (`insert_plugin` would then become `corroborated`; `set_plugin_param`, being reversible, `legacy_index_allowed`).

This exact set is pinned by census — it may only shrink, and any new operation added to the class fails CI until an explicit decision is made. The census discriminator is: **mutating**, target policy **`none`**, and carrying a track-strip selector (`track` or `track_index`). The bare `index` alias is deliberately *not* part of the discriminator: the operations that take `index` without a track-strip selector are the marker operations (`navigate.goto_marker`, `navigate.delete_marker`, `navigate.rename_marker`), whose `index` addresses a marker, not a track — a different wrong-target class that ADR-002 index binding does not cover.

### Track state values (`logic://tracks`)

Since v3.8.0, `logic://tracks` reports each track's `volume`, `pan`, and `automationMode` as REAL values read from the live track header (the same AX fader the mixer write path drives). These three were previously fabricated (`0.0` / `0.0` / `off`) by the production builder. The correction is **value-only** — the `TrackState` keys and types are unchanged (no new field, sentinel, or nullable), so existing parsers are unaffected. On a rare AX-read failure a field falls back to its former default, and the envelope's `source` / `ax_occluded` fields already flag degraded reads.

Track objects do **not** carry a sample rate. Sample rate is a project/transport-level value exposed on `logic://project/info`, which still falls back to a fabricated `44100` default when a live transport sample-rate is unavailable (documented limitation).

## Command Notes

### `logic_transport`

| Command | Params | Result | Route |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| `play`, `record` | none | text / contract envelope | Accessibility -> MCU -> CoreMIDI -> CGEvent -> AppleScript |
| `stop` | none | text / contract envelope | CGEvent -> Accessibility -> MCU -> CoreMIDI -> AppleScript |
| `pause`, `rewind`, `fast_forward` | none | text / contract envelope | routed transport fallback chain |
| `toggle_cycle` | — | text | Accessibility → MIDIKeyCommands → CGEvent → MCU |
| `toggle_count_in` | — | text / contract envelope | routed transport fallback chain |
| `toggle_autopunch` | — | State A/B/C contract envelope | Accessibility |
| `set_cycle_range` | `{ start, end }` | fails closed: current Logic builds expose no verifiable numeric cycle-locator automation path, so it returns State C (`not_implemented` / `readback_unavailable`) rather than claim an unverified success | Accessibility (attempted) |
| `set_tempo` | `{ tempo: number }` (5–999, matches Logic's actual accepted range) | text | Accessibility |
| `goto_position` | `{ bar: number }` or `{ position: string }` | text / contract envelope | Accessibility -> MIDIKeyCommands -> MMC |

Read current state from `logic://transport/state` after any transport mutation.

### `logic_tracks`

Use explicit indices or names. Track mutation fails closed when the target cannot be identified or read back.

Common commands: `select`, `create_audio`, `create_instrument`, `create_drummer`, `create_external_midi`, `delete`, `duplicate`, `rename`, `mute`, `solo`, `arm`, `arm_only`, `record_sequence`, `set_automation`, `set_instrument`, `list_library`, `scan_library`, `resolve_path`, `scan_plugin_presets`.

**`delete`, `duplicate`, and `set_instrument` no longer accept a bare index.** They are `corroborated` (see [Index binding](#index-binding)): pass `expected_name` (the track name you expect at that index) or `target_ref`. Without one, they fail closed with `index_binding_corroboration_required` and write nothing.

`set_automation` is State B (MCU write, no readback echo).

`mute`, `solo` and `arm` route Accessibility → MCU → CGEvent. On the MCU rung the Mackie Control Mute / Solo / Rec buttons toggle on a press, so the handler is a set only by reading first (#1020): it reads the track header's button through Accessibility (the same `AXValue` the Accessibility rung reads, `verification_source: ax_value`), sends nothing when that state already equals `enabled` (State A, `write_attempted: false`, `observed`), and otherwise sends one press with its release and polls the same read up to ten times at 50 ms. The read showing `enabled` is State A with `write_attempted: true` and `write_source: mcu`; still the old value is State B `readback_mismatch`, unreadable after the press is State B `readback_unavailable`, both with `write_attempted: true`, `observed` (null when unreadable) and no second press. When the state cannot be read before the press the handler sends nothing and answers State C `track_state_unreadable` with `write_attempted: false`; that code is not terminal, so the router moves on to the next channel. `enabled: false` takes the same path (it used to send a bare release, which Logic ignores). `select` on MCU is unchanged: one press, State B `readback_unavailable` (`verification_source: mcu_led_echo`).

Every strip-relative MCU write (`mute`, `solo`, `arm`, `select` and `set_automation` on the MCU rung, and the mixer's `set_volume` / `set_pan`) addresses a strip index, which names a track only relative to the bank Logic is showing. For a track outside the bank the server last placed, the handler walks the bank one step at a time, each step measured as `mixer.bank` measures it (one press, then a quiescent LCD upper-row redraw to a different row), and presses the strip only when every step toward its bank moved (#1020). A step that does not move stops the walk: the strip is not pressed, the steps that moved are walked back, and the answer is State C `bank_walk_unverified` with `write_attempted: false`, `bank_presses_sent`, `banks_moved`, `banks_requested`, `bank_restored`, `step_windows`, `bank_bookkeeping_after`, `operation` and `channel: "MCU"`. With no LCD upper row received yet the same refusal comes with nothing sent. `bank_walk_unverified` is not terminal, so the router moves on to the next channel. When the walk succeeds, the write's own reply carries the same bank fields, and `bank_restored: false` says the walk home stopped at a step that did not move. A track in the bank the server already counts as showing is written with no bank press and no bank reading.

When a bank-right step moves but the LCD upper row, read as eight 7-character cells, may be the old row slid by fewer than eight strips (Logic stops the last bank at the last strip, so with 21 strips the second bank-right press shows strips 13-20; repeated names can look the same), one probe settles it: Logic clamps only the last right step, so one more Bank Right that still moves the row proves the step moved a full eight, and a Bank Left must then redraw that step's row byte for byte before the walk continues. `bank_steps_disambiguated` counts the steps a probe proved; probe presses count in `bank_presses_sent`, not in `banks_moved`. A probe that redraws the same row (Logic's last bank) stops the walk, walks back and refuses `bank_walk_unverified` with `bank_step_short_of_eight: true`; a probe that reads back as neither refuses the same way with `bank_probe_unresolved: true`. A row longer than 56 characters is not provable and a bank-left step is never probed. `mixer.bank` probes the same way; after it makes a step the probe did not prove full, strip-relative MCU writes refuse `bank_walk_unverified` with nothing sent and `bank_window_unaligned: true` while the counter is off bank 0, until a `mixer.bank` left walk ends on an unchanged redraw at bank 0. Through the router, `track.set_arm`'s refusal surfaces as State C `channels_exhausted` with the keyboard channel's `last_error`, not the MCU's code, because the keyboard rung answers last.

For Library patches, treat `presetsByCategory` as a browse/catalog view. Default `scan_library` uses the local filesystem catalog from the user Logic Library plus Logic Pro's app bundle, dedupes relative `.patch` candidates, and reports `candidatePatchCount` plus `nonApplicablePatchCount` when a file candidate has no Panel-taxonomy route. Before calling `set_instrument`, call `resolve_path` and require `exists: true`, `kind: "leaf"`, and `loadable: true`. Folder/category rows return `loadable: false` and `set_instrument` fails closed with `folder_not_preset` instead of treating a selected row as a loaded patch.

`record_sequence` writes a server-generated MIDI file under a private server-managed temp directory, imports it into Logic, and verifies the created region. If the import returns an unverified State B result, including GM Device / External MIDI lanes that can bounce silent, `record_sequence` fails closed with `audibility_unverified` or `import_unverified` instead of promoting region readback to audible success.

### `logic_mixer`

Public commands: `set_volume`, `set_pan`, `set_master_volume`, `set_plugin_param`, `insert_plugin`, `bank`, `set_output_verified`.

`set_volume` and `set_pan` use Accessibility write/readback against the visible strip. They move the track-header slider by ~10-raw-unit detents, then by at most one detent of `AXValue` writes toward the whole raw position nearest the request (#973; one raw unit per write was measured on Logic 12.3.1 en-US, not promised for every build). `reached_exact` says whether it landed on that position; `fine_steps` counts accepted `AXValue` write calls, not necessarily movement; `verified` still means within the detent tolerance. A fine write that moves the slider further from the target returns State B `readback_mismatch` with `reason_detail` and leaves it there, including when the read after the fine phase fails and `observed_raw` is null. `write_method` stays `ax_increment_decrement`, the identifier of the detent path. `set_master_volume` requires MCU. `set_output`, `set_input`, `set_send`, `toggle_eq`, `reset_strip`, and `bypass_plugin` are recognized only to return State C `command_not_exposed` until their targets are deterministic.

`bank` moves the Mackie Control fader bank by eight strips per step: `{ direction: "left" | "right", count?: Int }` (`count` 1–31, default 1), MCU only. Its readback is the MCU LCD upper row, the 56-character line that names the eight visible strips. The move is made one step at a time: for each of `count` steps the server snapshots the upper row, sends one press, and polls until the row is redrawn and holds still. A step moved when a fresh upper-row write arrived after that press, the row then held still for one more poll, AND the row differs from that step's snapshot; the press having been sent never counts. Two presses sent back to back moved Logic 12.3 one bank, so presses are never batched. The walk stops at the first step that did not move, and no further press is sent. Every reply the `mixer.bank` handler gives carries `banks_moved` (steps witnessed), `bank_presses_sent` (presses actually sent) and `step_windows` (the row after each step sent), including its `invalid_params` refusal; every reply after the parameters parse also carries `banks_requested` (`count`); the router's `channels_exhausted` refusal described below comes before the handler runs and carries none of them. State A (`verify_source: mcu_lcd_upper_row`, with `window_before`, `window_after`, `strips`) means every one of the `count` presses produced its own redraw to a different row. It still does not say which bank is showing, and a row that changes for another reason in the same interval (a rename, Logic re-banking on selection) reads the same. When no step moved, State B `noop_unobservable` means the row redrew unchanged (identical six-character names cannot confirm a move) and State B `echo_timeout_<ms>ms` means no upper-row write arrived within the MCU echo timeout. When some steps moved and then one did not, the answer is State B with the moves counted: `readback_mismatch` with a `surface_limitation` when the stopping step redrew unchanged (the end of the mixer in that direction), `echo_timeout_<ms>ms` when it did not redraw. A cold start has two answers, and neither sends a byte. With no MCU feedback received yet, the shared channel-router health gate refuses the call before the handler runs, as it refuses every MCU operation: State C `channels_exhausted`, with `last_error` saying MCU feedback was not detected. With feedback received but no LCD upper row yet (for example a surface that has drawn only the lower row), the handler refuses: State C `readback_unavailable` with `write_attempted: false`, `bank_presses_sent: 0`, `banks_moved: 0`, `banks_requested` equal to the requested `count`, and `step_windows: []`. Each bank step is sent as a button press followed by its release, so Logic sees one momentary press per step rather than a held bank button. `bank_bookkeeping_before` / `bank_bookkeeping_after` carry the server's own bank counter. It moves by `banks_moved` only, and Logic's re-banking on track selection can leave it stale; the reply exposes that drift, it does not correct it.

`set_output_verified` sets one strip's output to one exact destination and reads it back from the same strip (#291 R2). It takes `track` (index) or `target_ref`, a `destination` of `{kind:"bus", number:N}` (1–256), `{kind:"physical", ports:[a,b]}` (two ascending port numbers), or `{kind:"stereo_output"}`, and an optional `expected_current` of the same shape or `{kind:"no_output"}`. `no_output` is refused as a destination (`invalid_params`): a strip set to No Output was measured to open no output menu, so this command could not set it back. No parameter is a localized label, and an unknown key is refused. Before anything is pressed it refuses with State C when the reference does not resolve; when the strip's current output does not read or does not classify (`readback_unavailable`: unreadable is not absent), or reads No Output (`unsupported_state`); when `expected_current` differs from it (`stale_snapshot`); when the transport is playing or recording (`unsupported_state`) or its state does not read (`transport_state_unknown`); when the strip reads a bus as its input and the destination bus reaches that bus, itself or through the outputs of the strips that receive it (`routing_cycle`); when a strip that check has to follow does not say where its signal goes: its input, output or sends did not read, or it has an occupied send, whose destination is not read (`routing_dependency_unknown`); when a bus destination has no receiver, i.e. no other strip reads that bus as its input (`bus_has_no_receiver`: Logic would create an aux, and creating one belongs to #967); and when a Logic popup menu is already open. A destination already in place is State A with `changed: false` and nothing pressed. Otherwise it presses that strip's output slot, takes the one popup that opened under the Mixer, and chooses the entry under the submenu that owns it: the buses under Bus, `Stereo Output` and the pairs under Output. The root's checked entry only echoes the current output and is never pressed. For a bus, the loop and receiver checks are made again from the Mixer's strips with the popup open, right before the entry is pressed: a strip that changed meanwhile refuses the same way, and a strip count that moved or a Mixer child that did not read refuses `unsupported_state` with `strip_count_at_press` (an ordinal names the same strip only while the count holds); each carries `read_with_popup_open: true`, and nothing is selected. AX has no compare-and-press, so a change after that read is seen only afterwards, as a strip count that moved. A destination the popup does not offer is refused with `element_not_found` and `offered`, one offered twice under one parent with `ambiguous_target_name`, and a menu whose entries' titles or submenus do not all read with `element_not_found` and `menu_failure: "menu_not_read"`, since an entry that did not read could be the destination or a second copy of it; none is pressed. The popup is closed and `popup_menu_state` says what was measured. State A requires the same strip, found again at the same ordinal after the press (Logic replaces a strip's elements when its output changes), to read back the destination, and the Mixer's strip count not to move. A count that grew is State C `unexpected_side_effect: "strip_created"` and nothing is cleaned up; an after-read that fails or disagrees is State B (`readback_unavailable` / `readback_mismatch`), and dependent writes should stop. Logic adds a Mixer strip for an output pair that no strip used before, and removes it once no strip uses the pair (measured in ko and de), so a move onto or off such a pair answers State C (`strip_created` / `strip_removed`) although the output did change; re-read `logic://mixer` to see it. Every reply carries the observed `before`; to restore, call again with `destination` set to it and `expected_current` set to the new value. That call is checked like any other, so it can be refused (the old bus with no other strip reading it any more is `bus_has_no_receiver`) or end in State C when the strip count moves (a physical pair no strip used before). `set_output` stays not-exposed.

Read `logic://mixer` before and after mixer mutations.

### `logic_plugins`

This is the verified apply-back surface.

Flow:

1. `get_inventory` reads the target track's plugin insert slots.
2. `insert_verified` inserts an allowlisted stock plugin into an explicit physical slot and verifies post-write inventory.
3. `logic_plugins.set_param_verified` writes a supported parameter and verifies readback.

Important constraints:

- `insert_verified` requires a confirmation gate named `duplicate_applyback` when the operation can mutate an existing session.
- `set_param_verified` currently verifies Compressor `threshold` only, normalized 0..100, tolerance 1.0.
- `set_param_verified` can open the target insert's plugin editor when it is closed, but it writes only after the requested AX slider is present in the acquired window.
- Arbitrary plugin parameters fail closed with `unsupported_param_readback`.
- The legacy Scripter `set_plugin_param` path is a legacy unverified State B path. Use `logic_plugins.set_param_verified` for verified apply-back.

Minimal `set_param_verified` shape:

```json
{
  "command": "set_param_verified",
  "track": 5,
  "insert": 6,
  "plugin": "logic.stock.effect.compressor",
  "param": "threshold",
  "value": 60,
  "unit": "normalized",
  "mode": "duplicate_applyback",
  "project_expected_path": "/path/to/project.logicx"
}
```

### `logic_midi`

Common commands: `send_note`, `send_chord`, `send_cc`, `send_program_change`, `send_pitch_bend`, `send_aftertouch`, `send_sysex`, `play_sequence`, `import_file`, `list_ports`, `create_virtual_port`, `step_input`, `mmc_play`, `mmc_stop`, `mmc_record`, `mmc_locate`.

Channels are 1-based (`1..16`) to match Logic's UI.

`send_sysex` accepts `{ bytes: [Int] }` or `{ data: "F0 ... F7" }` and rejects payloads over 1024 bytes before routing to CoreMIDI.

Send-only success responses return an Honest Contract State B JSON envelope because CoreMIDI/MMC writes have no deterministic readback:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "verified": false,
  "state": "B",
  "reason": "send_only_no_readback",
  "operation": "midi.send_note",

`mmc_locate` with a `bar` parameter is the exception: it routes through `transport.goto_position` and keeps the transport readback contract. Time-based `mmc_locate` remains send-only State B.

`create_virtual_port` reuses same-name/same-mode ports. Reusing a name across modes fails closed with State C `port_unavailable` and includes `port_name`, `existing_mode`, and `requested_mode`.

No MIDI read-back command is shipped: `read_selection_notes` and `record_sequence verify_notes` remain deferred.

### `logic_edit`

Common commands: `undo`, `redo`, `cut`, `copy`, `paste`, `delete`, `select_all`, `split`, `join`, `quantize`, `bounce_in_place`, `normalize`, `duplicate`, `toggle_step_input`.

`quantize` requires `{ value: String }` or `{ grid: String }` and accepts the dispatcher grids `1/1`, `1/2`, `1/4`, `1/8`, `1/16`, `1/32`, `1/64`, `1/4T`, `1/8T`, and `1/16T`.

### `logic_navigate`

Common commands: `goto_bar`, `goto_marker`, `create_marker`, `delete_marker`, `rename_marker`, `zoom_to_fit`, `set_zoom`, `toggle_view`.

`delete_marker` and indexed `goto_marker` require explicit indices. `rename_marker` is not implemented on Logic 12.x and returns State C `not_implemented`. `set_zoom` accepts `in`, `out`, `fit`, or integer levels `1..10` and uses the writable Accessibility zoom slider when present.

### `logic_project`

Common commands: `new`, `open`, `save`, `save_as`, `close`, `bounce`, `is_running`, `launch`, `quit`, `get_regions`, `export_plan`, `export_run`, `export_resume`, `audit`, `cleanup_plan`, `inspect_session`, `cleanup_apply`.

Destructive or file-writing paths require confirmation. `save_as` verifies the resulting `.logicx` package. `audit` marks GM Device / External MIDI tracks with MIDI regions as `external_midi_regions_bounce_risk` export blockers. `bounce` runs that preflight, then opens and verifies Logic's native File > Bounce dialog; the caller completes the settings and destination in Logic. It returns `export_readiness_blocked` before opening the dialog when blockers are present. `export_plan` is read-only. Its `stem` form deliberately refuses unless exactly one currently scanned project has a fresh, project-coherent complete region inventory proving its populated tracks and `output_root` is an existing readable directory. A dry plan cannot inspect Logic's Export-panel browser without opening it, so browser visibility is an execution-time precondition: the driver refuses an existing directory that is not exposed there and never navigates arbitrary paths or creates folders. Stem filenames and output format are late-bound and unpromised. For stems, `fail_if_exists` examines only top-level non-directory entries with suffix `wav`, `wave`, `aif`, `aiff`, `aifc`, `m4a`, or `mp3`, and refuses if enumeration fails or the authoritative immediately-pre-export snapshot is non-empty; files that appear only after that snapshot are observations, not attributed produced artifacts. `skip_existing` and `export_resume` refuse stems because Logic assigns filenames only after export. `export_run` re-plans, opens, verifies project identity, drives the stem Export panel or bounces as appropriate, and analyzes only eligible files observed in the destination's before/after snapshot. It reports one result per populated stem subject but does not invent a filename-to-subject association or claim an observed post-snapshot file was produced by Logic; unbound subject results remain State B. `export_resume` remains available for known-path artifacts.

`inspect_session` (#965, first increment) returns a `logic_pro_mcp_session_population.v1` report built from the state cache alone: no Accessibility call, no UI navigation, nothing restored. Params: `scope?` (`whole_project` | `selection`), `domains?` (array of `tracks`, `strips`, `associations`, `hierarchy`, `routing`, `color`; default the first four), `allow_ui_navigation?` (Bool; `true` is refused with State C `not_implemented` in this increment), `project_ref?`. Every requested domain carries `coverage` (`complete` | `partial` | `unavailable` | `unstable`) and `reasons[]`; `tracks` and `strips` carry witnessed `rows[]`; `overall.complete` is true only when every requested domain is `complete`. The cache cannot see hidden tracks, the children of a collapsed stack, strip names, or which strip belongs to which track, so `associations` and `hierarchy` are `unavailable` and a cold, contaminated, or unread cache is reported as `unavailable` rather than as an empty session. `snapshot_id` names the cache revision the report was read from; nothing consumes it yet. Counts alone do not establish completion, so in this increment `tracks` is never `complete`: a matching project-file count is kept as evidence (`witnesses.expected_count`, `expected_count_matches_rail`) with the reason `count_is_the_only_end_witness`; a count from a bundle that is not the cached project's is not reported (`project_file_not_bound`); rows older than 30 seconds add `track_cache_stale`; `scope: selection` adds `selection_state_unverified`, because an unreadable AXSelected reads as unselected. Any section version, `ax_occluded` or document flag that moves during the capture makes every requested domain `unstable`, including a flag that flips and flips back before the capture ends. A `project_ref` that no longer names the project the cache holds is refused with State C `stale_target_reference`, `write_attempted: false`, and nothing is bound. A requested `routing` section (#291 R1) is built by the same publication `logic://mixer` uses, over the same capture: `graph` carries that graph's per-domain `coverage` verbatim and `snapshot_id` its `snapshot_id`; the section is `unavailable` (`routing_graph_unavailable`) before any mixer poll, `unstable` when the capture moved (`cache_moved_during_capture`) or a reference snapshot went stale during issuance (`target_snapshot_stale`), and otherwise `partial` (`routing_graph_partial`).

`get_regions` returns `{ regions, complete, scope, reason, returned_count, _debug }`. Logic's AX tree currently exposes the visible arrange viewport only, so the response reports `complete:false`, `scope:"visible_arrange_area"`, and `reason:"logic_ax_viewport_only"`; callers must not treat `regions` as a project-wide inventory. Project audit preserves that limitation as `ax_visible_subset`, emits `region_inventory_partial`, and withholds empty-track claims for unseen lanes.

### `logic_audio`

`analyze_file` inspects an existing audio artifact and reports duration, level, silence ratio, and verification status. It does not mutate Logic.

### `logic_system`

Common commands: `health`, `permissions`, `refresh_cache`, `export_support_bundle`, `setup_arm_key`, `setup_control_surface`, `list_menus`, `click_menu`, `list_recent_traces`, `get_trace`, `clear_traces`, `saga_preflight`, `saga_execute`, `saga_status`, `saga_cancel`, `help`.

Use `health` for channel readiness and `help` for command summaries. `help` accepts category `all`, `transport`, `tracks`, `mixer`, `midi`, `edit`, `navigate`, `project`, `audio`, `plugins`, or `system`.

#### `list_menus` and `click_menu`

`list_menus` reads Logic's whole menu bar through the Accessibility API, without opening any menu, and returns the tree: every top-level menu (with its `menu_bar_index` and whether `click_menu` accepts it) and, recursively, every item's exact AX `title`, `path` (titles from the menu bar down), `enabled` (`true`, `false`, or `null` when `AXEnabled` could not be read), `has_submenu`, and `shortcut` (`key`, `modifiers`, `raw_modifiers`, `display`, decoded from `AXMenuItemCmdChar` / `AXMenuItemCmdModifiers`) when the item has one. Separators are skipped. Optional params: `menu` (one top-level menu, matched the same way `click_menu` matches) and `max_depth` (item levels below the menu bar, 1-5, default 3; a submenu below the limit is marked `items_truncated_at_max_depth`). The response carries `ui_locale` from the product's locale detector and always `titles_may_be_stale_until_opened: true`: Logic rewrites some titles only when their menu opens (the Edit menu's Undo row is the measured case), and this read does not open menus. A tree that read completely is State A; one with unreadable parts is State B `readback_unavailable` with `complete: false` and an `unreadable` list.

`click_menu` presses one menu item. `path` is the list of titles from the menu bar down, as an array (`["Track", "New Tracks..."]`) or one string separated by `" > "`; at most six titles. `confirmed: true` is required (L2, like `clear_traces`). Titles are matched against the LIVE AX titles only, never against a built-in label, so it works in whatever language Logic runs: matching trims whitespace, reads U+00A0 as a space and `…` as `...`, and ignores case. It refuses (State C, nothing pressed) when a title matches no sibling (the error lists `available_titles`), when it matches more than one, when the last item has a submenu, when its `AXEnabled` is `false` or unreadable, when the path starts at the Apple menu (menu-bar item 0), and when the item's shortcut is Command-Q — use `logic_project quit` for that. A successful press is State B `readback_unavailable` with `path_matched` (the actual AX titles) and `ui_locale`: the press was accepted, and what the item did is not read back.

#### `setup_arm_key` (v3.12.0)

Consent-gated auto-setup for Logic's "Toggle Track Record Enable" key command — the coordinate-free arm actuator's prerequisite. Without `consent: true` it returns State C `consent_required` before any parameter validation or mutation (consent-first). With consent it runs verify-first: it drives a real record-arm flip **and restore** using only the configured chord, so an already-working mapping short-circuits to State A (`write_source: "existing_mapping_verify"`) with zero GUI mutation; otherwise it performs the assignment in Logic's Key Commands window and functionally re-verifies the new mapping the same way. Every outcome is an Honest Contract envelope: State A only after an observed flip AND restore; a chord already owned by another command fails closed as `chord_conflict` and is never stolen; an environment with no selectable track fails closed as `verify_environment_unavailable` with no GUI mutation attempted. Evidence fields include `configuration_write_attempted`, `verification_mutation_attempted`, `restored`, `safe_to_retry`, and (GUI path) window/search/selection/learn readbacks. Set `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_ARM_KEYCODE` / `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_ARM_MODIFIERS` to choose a non-default chord.

Operation tracing is on by default (set `LOGIC_MCP_ADR005_OPERATION_TRACE=0` to disable), so every **successful** mutating result (State A/B) carries a `trace_id`; State C failures do not (nothing was traced to completion). `list_recent_traces` returns bounded summaries from the in-process trace store and accepts optional `limit`.
`get_trace` returns one stored trace by required `trace_id`.
`clear_traces` clears only the in-process trace store and requires `confirmed:true` because it destroys in-session diagnostic evidence.

#### Measuring the AppleScript segment (v3.13+)

`midi.import_file` runs under three nested time budgets: the operation deadline, the bound on its `osascript` call, and the Swift-side AX polling around it. Only the outermost one used to cross the process boundary, so the middle budget — the one that produced the `midi.import_file` timeout reported in #449 — could be reasoned about but not measured. Summing the script's own `delay` statements is not a substitute: those sums omit every AX query and file operation between the delays, so they cannot establish real headroom.

Traces for that operation now carry a `script_segment.completed` event with an `applescript_duration_ms` attribute: the measured elapsed time of the `osascript` call, taken with a monotonic clock so an NTP correction cannot invent or erase it. Compare it against the bound in `ServerConfig.midiImportAppleScriptTimeout` to read actual headroom on a given machine and project.

The attribute is diagnostic only. Nothing gates on it, it is never a verification signal, and it carries no user content — only an elapsed count of milliseconds.

`saga_preflight` and `saga_execute` accept `{ steps: [step], idempotency_key: String }`; each step contains `operation_id`, optional `target_ref`, `params`, and `expected_inverse`. Preflight performs no Logic writes and reports per-step before-state availability. Execute reports verified per-step evidence; a failed request remains State C even when every applied step is compensated, while partial or unknown compensation is State B.

The bounded journal belongs only to the current server session and is cleared on session end or process restart. A completed duplicate key returns its stored outcome with `duplicate:true`; `saga_status` reads that record. `saga_status` and `saga_cancel` take exactly `{ idempotency_key: String }`; any other key is `invalid_params`. `saga_cancel` on an in-flight saga records the request and returns State B `saga_cancellation_pending` with `status: "cancellation_requested"`, and a repeated request answers the same. Once the unwind is journaled it returns `status: "cancelled"` with the stored outcome: State A when the unwind was verified, State B `saga_reconciliation_required` when it was not. An unknown key is State C `element_not_found`, a completed saga is State C `unsupported_state`, and a terminal key whose body was dropped answers `saga_outcome_unavailable` as described below (`SystemDispatcher` `saga_cancel`, `SagaJournal.cancel`). Ordered work with compensation does not promise all-or-nothing completion or durable recovery.

The journal keeps two independently bounded tiers, so pressure costs stored evidence rather than safety:

- **Replay protection (whole session).** Every `idempotency_key` begun in a session stays recorded for that whole session. A key that reached a terminal state never starts again — replay protection does not lapse, expire, or time out. There is no wall-clock TTL.
- **Outcome bodies (most recent N).** Full stored outcomes are retained for the most recent `journal_record_capacity` sagas (default 1024). Under insertion pressure the oldest terminal body is dropped; in-flight sagas are never dropped.

Retrying an older completed saga whose body was dropped returns `saga_outcome_unavailable` (State C, terminal) instead of the original body — never a re-execution. It carries `terminal_kind` (`completed` or `cancelled`), `outcome_retained:false`, `safe_to_retry:false`, and `write_attempted:false`. `terminal_kind` names only which path the saga terminated on; it is **not** a claim that the intent succeeded (a `completed` saga may have applied only partially). Reconcile by observing current state via `saga_status` or the relevant read operations — do not re-fire the same intent blindly. `saga_status` for such a key still reports its terminal `status` with `outcome_retained:false` and no `outcome`.

`saga_journal_capacity_exceeded` remains distinct and unchanged in meaning: the journal cannot admit a **new** key. It is returned under either of two conditions — the session's replay-protection tier (`journal_compact_capacity`, default 65536) is full, or the outcome tier is fully occupied by in-flight sagas and therefore holds no terminal body that can be reclaimed. Both stay fail-closed: admitting a key the session cannot replay-protect, or evicting a saga still running, would be a correctness hole rather than an availability one.

`saga_status` and `saga_preflight` publish `journal_full_body_count`, `journal_compact_count`, `journal_body_evictions`, `journal_compact_capacity`, and `journal_record_capacity` for operators. These are diagnostics only — none of them promises that a later retry will fit, and `journal_survives_process_restart` stays `false`.

### Not-exposed commands

A few command tokens are recognised by the dispatchers but are deliberately **not part of the production MCP contract** (no deterministic / verified path exists yet). They are excluded from the workflow command census and return a single machine-classifiable State C shape — `error: "command_not_exposed"`, `not_exposed: true`, `supported: false`, plus the `operation` — so a complete-surface demo/test harness can classify them as *expected*, not a malfunction:

- `logic_tracks.set_color`
- `logic_mixer.set_send`, `logic_mixer.set_output`, `logic_mixer.set_input`, `logic_mixer.toggle_eq`, `logic_mixer.reset_strip`, `logic_mixer.bypass_plugin`

## Error Format

State C errors use stable machine-readable strings such as `invalid_params`, `not_implemented`, `command_not_exposed`, `index_out_of_range`, `element_not_found`, `readback_mismatch`, `port_unavailable`, `channels_exhausted`, `unsupported_param_readback`, and `confirmation_required`.

Clients should branch on `state`, `verified`, `error`, and `retry_safe`; do not parse human prose as the contract.
