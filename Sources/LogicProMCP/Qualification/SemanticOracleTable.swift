// #373 Phase A — the oracle table.
//
// Every entry was derived by reading the operation's dispatcher handler and
// pinning what that handler ACTUALLY emits. Comments cite the handler so a
// future shape change is reconciled here rather than silently passing.
//
// Census invariant (meta-tested): the table's keys are exactly the registry's
// read-only specs whose availability is not `.unsupported`, minus
// `system.health` which keeps its bespoke full-payload equality validator.
//
// ── KNOWN GAPS (Phase A ships with these open; carried as Phase B debt) ──────
//
// 1. FIXTURE↔HANDLER DRIFT HAS NO AUTOMATIC GUARD. Every oracle here was
//    derived by READING its dispatcher, and the payloads in
//    SemanticOracleFixtures were hand-written to match. Nothing mechanically
//    binds the two: if a handler changes a key tomorrow, the fixture keeps the
//    old shape, the oracle keeps passing the stale fixture, and CI stays green
//    while the live surface has drifted. Phase B should close this by emitting
//    golden samples from the handlers' own encode paths, or by landing the
//    live-run drift catcher. Until then, treat green fixtures as evidence the
//    ORACLE LOGIC works — not as evidence the shapes are current.
//
// 2. SIX READ-ONLY OPERATIONS ARE SHORT OF `passed`, AND NOT FOR THE REASON THIS
//    NOTE USED TO GIVE. It said six operations could not reach `passed` for want
//    of probe parameters and prescribed supplying them. They have had them for
//    some time -- `probeParams` hands `tracks.resolve_path`, `audio.analyze_file`,
//    `project.export_plan`, `plugins.get_inventory` and `system.saga_status`
//    qualifying values -- so the note prescribed work already done, and nobody
//    could tell because no run printed the names. It does now
//    (`read-only short of passed` in QualificationRunnerTests).
//
//    Measured 2026-08-24, one-track project open, 6 of 23 read-only short:
//
//      audio.analyze_spectrum      gated behind LOGIC_MCP_ADR012_SPECTRAL_EQ=1 (#300)
//      audio.recommend_eq          same flag
//      tracks.list_library         library surface
//      tracks.scan_plugin_presets  library surface
//      tracks.resolve_path         deterministic MISS by design; the HIT branch
//                                  needs a fixture library, not a different string
//      system.clear_traces         deliberate `confirmed:false`; reaching its
//                                  success path would destroy diagnostic evidence
//
//    Only two of these overlap the six the old note named. Two are a promotion
//    decision on #300 rather than qualification work, and two are deliberate and
//    should stay short. That leaves the library surface as the real Phase-A
//    remainder.
//
//    Coverage also moves with fixture state: the same binary scored
//    `passed=15` with no document open and `passed=17` with a one-track project.
//    A coverage number quoted without its fixture state is not reproducible.
//
// 3. THREE MORE ARE ENVIRONMENT-CONDITIONAL live: project.get_regions,
//    tracks.list_library and tracks.scan_plugin_presets need Logic running with
//    (respectively) an arrange viewport, an open Library panel, and a focused
//    plugin window.
//
// 4. midi.list_ports' cross-check is a SAME-HANDLER ECHO, not an independent
//    readback — see its oracle's reason. No independent MIDI probe exists yet.

    //
    // Phase A/B0 covered ONLY the read-only surface, and the census pinned it
    // exactly: every read-only spec had an oracle, and every oracle mapped back
    // to a read-only spec. B1 begins the MUTATING surface, so a read-only-only
    // census can no longer be sound — a mutating oracle has no read-only spec to
    // map back to. The census is therefore generalized to two axes with DELIBER-
    // ATELY DIFFERENT completeness contracts:
    //
    //   * read-only  — FULLY covered (all 22; `coveredSpecIDs`), unchanged.
    //   * mutating   — covered INCREMENTALLY. B1 lands the verified-write oracles
    //                  below; B2/B3 add the rest. Full 51-op mutating coverage is
    //                  NOT required yet, so the census must not demand it.
    //
    // Soundness is kept by pinning the mutating increment EXACTLY
    // (`phaseB1MutatingOperationIDs`) and by proving every id in it is a real
    // `.mutating`, non-`.unsupported` registry spec — a read-only id or a typo
    // cannot masquerade as mutating coverage, and the read-only 22 stay pinned.

    // `.numericRange(min: 1)`. `requested_delta:1` is the create intent,
    // `verification_source:"track_count_delta"` is how it was verified, and
    // `track_type_verification_source:"observed_header"` records that the type
    // came from the newly observed header rather than from the requested menu
    // item.
    //
    // #766 — `observed_track_type` was pinned here as "the PER-OP discriminator", and it
    // discriminated nothing. Measured 2026-09-04: the header aggregate carries identical type
    // tokens for every track, because the Input Monitoring button's help names an audio track and
    // a software instrument track in the same sentence, so the classifier answered `audio` for all
    // four operations. Three of these four oracles could not pass against live Logic, and nothing
    // reported that because no live qualification run had exercised them — the unit fixtures hand
    // the oracle a canned response carrying the value the product cannot produce.
    //
    // The first fix here moved the pin to `requested_track_type`, and an outside review showed that
    // is worse rather than better: that field is `expectedTrackType.rawValue`, assigned from the
    // argument BEFORE anything is verified, so pinning it checks that the handler echoed its own
    // input. A response claiming `requested_track_type:"audio"` alongside
    // `observed_track_type:"drummer"` would have passed.
    //
    // So there is no per-op pin. With the type unreadable from the header there is nothing in this
    // response that distinguishes one create from another, and saying so is the honest state:
    // these four oracles check that A track was created and that the envelope is well formed, not
    // WHICH kind. Both fields are pinned as typed fields so a missing one is still caught.
    //
    // 2026-09-09: the channel-strip read now exists, and it does NOT restore a full discriminator.
    // An input slot marks audio and the external-MIDI shape marks external MIDI, but a DRUMMER strip
    // is identical to a software instrument's — same `MIDI Effect slot`, differing only in the
    // plug-in loaded — so that case reports a family and `observed_track_type` stays `unknown`. The
    // per-op pin therefore stays on `requested_track_type`.
    //
    // What did change is the PROVENANCE field, which now carries one of three tokens instead of the
    // single constant this pinned. Leaving `valueEquals(observed_header)` here would have made live
    // qualification reject the feature's own successful outputs — the read succeeds, the source says
